## Overview


Have you ever been out and about and _suddenly_ your group decides it's time to karaoke? You're super stoked and ready to have some fun, but all of a sudden you can't seem to remember your favorite karaoke songs üò± !

If only you had a better memory! If only you hadn't had those last two (or three, or four...) drinks! Well, worry not! CarryOkay has you covered! With this app, you can carry a list of your favorite songs around with you or even search for tried and true crowd favorites to sing on the fly!

As a user, you can tap or click the ‚ô° to add a song from the Song Book to your personal library. Not into it as much as you were last night? Simply remove it by tapping or clicking the ‚õîÔ∏è on your 'My Songs' page. Tap or click the üé§ icon to see the lyrics of your desired song in a convenient pop-up, or search for songs by title, artist, or genre!

CarryOkay: the app you carry, the app that makes everything okay, the app for karaoke!

## Instructions for Installation

  `To run this application on your local machine, clone down this repo, change into the root directory from the command line, and run `npm install`. 
    
  Then run `npm   start` to open the application locally. 
    
  To run the test suite locally, you will also need to run the command `npm i -D cypress` from the command line.
    
  Once it  has installed, run `npx cypress open`, then select the `carry_okay_spec.js` test file. 
    
  Note: you will need to run the application locally (start the server with `npm start` from the root directory on the command line) in order to run the automated tests.`

## Future Iterations

 - Add functionality to make genre buttons clickable --> navigate to a library of songs that pertain to that genre
 - Add log-in functionality for users, save, update, or delete users' data in a PostgreSQL table in our database with either a POST, PUT, or DELETE network request
 - Add a helpful message on the `My Songs` view that would display if a user has no songs currently saved
