## Synopsis

Have you ever been out and about and _suddenly_ your group decides it's time to karaoke? You're super stoked and ready to have some fun, but all of a sudden you can't seem to remember your favorite karaoke songs ðŸ˜± !

If only you had a better memory! If only you hadn't had those last two (or three, or four...) drinks! Well, worry not! CarryOkay has you covered! With this app, you can carry a list of your favorite songs around with you or even search for tried and true crowd favorites to sing on the fly!

As a user, you can tap or click the â™¡ to add a song to your personal library. Not into it as much as you were last night? Simply remove it by tapping or clicking the filled â™¡ on your 'My Songs' page. Tap or click the ðŸŽ¤ icon to see the lyrics of your desired song in a convenient pop-up.
CarryOkay: the app you carry, the app that makes everything okay, the app for karaoke!
